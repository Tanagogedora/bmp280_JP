Modified and extended by Tanagotti, 2025

This extension is based on the original MicroPython code for the BMP280 sensor by the Chinese community.  
Major modifications include:

- üåê UI localization: Changed from English-only to bilingual (English and Japanese) block definitions and documentation.
- üìè Data formatting:  
  - Temperature is now shown with one decimal place (was integer only).  
  - Pressure is now displayed with rounding to the second decimal place for both Pa and hPa (was truncated to integer).
- üßπ Code structure: Reorganized the source into a TypeScript namespace. Added detailed inline annotations in both English and Japanese for educational use.
- üß≤ Output consistency: Modified temperature and pressure display logic to apply consistent rounding instead of truncation.

These improvements enhance readability and usability in bilingual STEM education environments, particularly for students conducting experiments with micro:bit and BMP280 sensors.
